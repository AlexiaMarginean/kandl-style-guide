# K&L CSS Style Guide

CSS style guide for all K&amp;L products.

## Table of Contents
1. Spacing
2. Formatting

## Spacing
+ Use soft-tabs (spaces) with a two space indent.
+ Put a single space after the `:` in propery declarations.
+ Put a single space before the `{` in rule declarations.
+ Put a single line break between rulesets.
+ When grouping selectors, keep individual selectors to a single line.
+ Place closing braces of declaration blocks on a new line.

## Formatting
+ Use hex color codes `#000` unless using `rgba()`.
+ Avoid specifying units for zero values, e.g., `margin: 0;` instead of `margin: 0px;`.
* Order properties within a declaration block alphabetically, for instance `margin` goes before `padding`.
